# 🏢 Enterprise SAST Setup Guide
## Scaling Security Across Large Organizations

This guide covers enterprise-grade deployment and configuration of the SAST platform for organizations with multiple teams, projects, and compliance requirements.

## 🎯 Enterprise Use Cases

### Multi-Project Organizations
```yaml
organization: "tech-company"
projects:
  - frontend-app (React/TypeScript)
  - backend-api (Node.js/Python)
  - mobile-app (React Native)
  - infrastructure (Terraform)
  - data-pipeline (Python/SQL)
```

### Team Specializations
- **Frontend Teams** → React, Vue, Angular security scanning
- **Backend Teams** → API security, dependency scanning
- **DevOps Teams** → Infrastructure as Code security
- **Full-Stack Teams** → Comprehensive multi-language scanning

### Compliance Requirements
- **SOC 2 Type II** compliance automation
- **ISO 27001** security controls
- **PCI DSS** for payment processing
- **HIPAA** for healthcare applications
- **GDPR** privacy protection

## 🏗️ Enterprise Architecture

### Centralized Configuration Management
```yaml
# enterprise-config.yml
organization:
  name: "${ORG_NAME}"
  default_branch: "main"
  security_contact: "${SECURITY_EMAIL}"
  governance_level: "enterprise"

# Template variables for standardization
template_variables:
  project_name: "${PROJECT_NAME}"
  project_type: "${PROJECT_TYPE}"
  tech_stack: "${TECH_STACK}"
  compliance_requirements: "${COMPLIANCE_REQS}"
  criticality_level: "${CRITICALITY}" # low|medium|high|critical

# Environment-specific overrides
environments:
  development:
    security_threshold: "low"
    notifications: "minimal"
  staging:
    security_threshold: "medium"
    notifications: "standard"
  production:
    security_threshold: "high"
    notifications: "full"
```

### Governance Framework
```yaml
governance:
  branch_protection:
    enabled: true
    required_reviews: 2
    dismiss_stale_reviews: true
  
  quality_gates:
    enabled: true
    critical_vulnerabilities: 0
    high_vulnerabilities: 2
  
  compliance_checks:
    enabled: true
    frameworks: ["soc2", "iso27001", "pci-dss"]
```

## 🚀 Deployment Strategies

### Multi-Tier Governance
```yaml
governance_levels:
  basic: # Startups, small teams
    required_scanners: ["semgrep", "eslint"]
    quality_gates:
      critical: 0
      high: 5
    notifications: ["slack"]
    
  standard: # Growing companies
    required_scanners: ["codeql", "semgrep", "eslint", "dependency-check"]
    quality_gates:
      critical: 0
      high: 2
      medium: 10
    notifications: ["slack", "email"]
    compliance_checks: true
    
  enterprise: # Large organizations
    required_scanners: ["codeql", "semgrep", "snyk", "checkmarx"]
    quality_gates:
      critical: 0
      high: 0
      medium: 5
    notifications: ["slack", "email", "jira", "pagerduty"]
    compliance_checks: true
    audit_trail: true
    sla_monitoring: true
```

### Phased Rollout Strategy
```yaml
rollout_phases:
  phase_1_pilot: # 2 weeks
    scope: "1-2 non-critical projects"
    scanners: ["basic-set"]
    monitoring: "intensive"
    
  phase_2_expansion: # 4 weeks
    scope: "25% of projects"
    scanners: ["standard-set"]
    monitoring: "standard"
    
  phase_3_organization: # 8 weeks
    scope: "all projects"
    scanners: ["full-set"]
    monitoring: "automated"
```

## 🎯 Implementation Steps

### 1. Assessment & Planning
```bash
# Assess current security posture
./sast-init.sh --validate-only

# Plan deployment strategy
./scripts/enterprise-assessment.sh --org "YourOrg"
```

### 2. Pilot Deployment
```bash
# Start with pilot projects
./setup.sh --production --project "pilot-project"

# Configure enterprise settings
cp configs/examples/enterprise.yaml ci-config.yaml
```

### 3. Organization Rollout
```bash
# Deploy across organization
./scripts/enterprise-rollout.sh \
  --governance-level enterprise \
  --compliance soc2,pci-dss \
  --rollout-phase expansion
```

### 4. Monitoring & Optimization
```bash
# Monitor deployment success
./scripts/enterprise-monitoring.sh --dashboard

# Optimize based on metrics
./scripts/optimization-analyzer.sh --org-wide
```
