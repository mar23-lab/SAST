## 🔧 DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES & STANDARDS

### **Code Quality Standards**
```yaml
Shell Scripts:
  - Use bash with set -euo pipefail for error handling
  - Include comprehensive logging (log_info, log_error functions)
  - Color-coded output for user experience
  - Validate all dependencies before execution
  - Provide --help and usage examples

Python Scripts:
  - Type hints for all function parameters
  - Comprehensive error handling with try/catch
  - JSON/YAML processing with proper validation
  - CLI interfaces using argparse
  - Unit tests for critical functions

Configuration:
  - YAML format with clear commenting
  - Environment variable support
  - Validation schemas where possible
  - Example configurations for common scenarios
  - Version compatibility documentation
```

### **Architecture Principles**
```yaml
Developer Experience First:
  - Convention over configuration
  - Zero-configuration defaults that work for 80% of cases
  - Progressive enhancement (basic → advanced features)
  - Clear error messages with actionable solutions

Security by Design:
  - Secure defaults (fail-safe, conservative thresholds)
  - Secrets management via environment variables
  - HTTPS/TLS for all external communications
  - Input validation and sanitization

Observability:
  - Comprehensive logging at all levels
  - Metrics collection for performance monitoring
  - Health checks for all services
  - Audit trails for security events
```

### **Testing Strategy**
```yaml
Automated Testing:
  - Demo mode for safe integration testing
  - Real repository testing (test_real_repo.sh)
  - Configuration validation scripts
  - Service health checks

Manual Testing Scenarios:
  - New project onboarding (greenfield)
  - Existing project integration (brownfield)
  - Multi-project organization setup
  - Enterprise compliance configuration

Performance Testing:
  - Large repository scanning (1000+ files)
  - Concurrent scanning workloads

## 🛠️ CURSOR AI DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE

### **How Cursor Should Approach This Project**

#### **Understanding Context**
```yaml
Primary Goals:
  1. Reduce developer onboarding from hours to minutes
  2. Achieve 90%+ setup success rate
  3. Provide enterprise-grade security scanning
  4. Maintain multi-platform compatibility

Key Constraints:
  - Must work across GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab
  - Zero-configuration should work for 80% of cases
  - Security findings must be actionable
  - Enterprise compliance requirements
```

#### **Development Approach**
```yaml
Code Generation Strategy:
  - Always include error handling and logging
  - Provide comprehensive help text and examples
  - Use consistent naming conventions across files
  - Include validation for all user inputs
  - Generate both minimal and comprehensive configurations

Testing Integration:
  - Every new feature should have demo mode support
  - Include both positive and negative test cases
  - Provide clear success/failure indicators
  - Generate realistic test data for demonstrations
```

#### **File Modification Guidelines**
```yaml
When Modifying Core Files:
  ci-config.yaml:
    - Maintain backward compatibility
    - Add comprehensive comments for new parameters
    - Include example values and valid ranges
    - Update CONFIG_GUIDE.md simultaneously

  setup.sh:
    - Preserve existing error handling patterns
    - Add new dependencies to prerequisites check
    - Update banner and usage information
    - Test all deployment modes (demo, production, minimal)

  Workflow Files:
    - Ensure GitHub Actions compatibility
    - Add appropriate timeout and retry logic
    - Include artifact storage for results
    - Support matrix builds for multiple platforms
```

### **Common Development Patterns**

#### **Configuration Management Pattern**
```bash
# Standard pattern for reading configuration
CONFIG_FILE="${CONFIG_FILE:-ci-config.yaml}"
if [[ ! -f "$CONFIG_FILE" ]]; then
    log_error "Configuration file not found: $CONFIG_FILE"
    echo "Run: cp ci-config.yaml.example ci-config.yaml"
    exit 1
fi

# Use yq for YAML processing
SETTING=$(yq eval '.section.parameter // "default_value"' "$CONFIG_FILE")
```

#### **Service Health Check Pattern**
```bash
# Standard health check with retries
check_service_health() {
    local service_name="$1"
    local health_url="$2"
    local max_retries="${3:-30}"
    
    for ((i=1; i<=max_retries; i++)); do
        if curl -s "$health_url" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
            log_success "$service_name is ready"
            return 0
        fi
        log_info "Waiting for $service_name... ($i/$max_retries)"
        sleep 2
    done
    
    log_error "$service_name failed to start after $max_retries attempts"
    return 1
}
```

#### **Error Handling Pattern**
```bash
# Comprehensive error handling with cleanup
set -euo pipefail

cleanup_on_error() {
    log_error "Operation failed. Cleaning up..."
    docker-compose down >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
    exit 1
}

trap cleanup_on_error ERR
```

## 🎯 FINAL GUIDANCE FOR CURSOR

### **Development Philosophy**
**"Developer Delight Through Security Excellence"**

Every change should ask: "Does this make security easier or harder for developers?" If it makes it harder, find a different approach.

### **Code Generation Principles**
1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality first, advanced features optional
2. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Conservative settings that work in most environments
3. **Clear Error Messages**: Every error should include next steps
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Debug information without overwhelming output
5. **Platform Agnostic**: Code should work across GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab

### **Quality Standards**
```yaml
Every New File Should Include:
  - Comprehensive header comment with purpose
  - Usage examples and parameter documentation
  - Error handling with graceful degradation
  - Logging at appropriate levels
  - Input validation and sanitization

Every Configuration Change Should Include:
  - Backward compatibility preservation
  - Default values that work out-of-box
  - Clear documentation with examples
  - Validation and error messages
  - Migration path from previous versions
```

### **Success Definition**
**The project succeeds when a developer can run `./sast init --repo [URL]` and have a fully functional, enterprise-grade security scanning platform operational in under 15 minutes with 90%+ success rate.**

---

**🎯 This documentation provides Cursor with comprehensive context to deliver world-class developer experience while maintaining enterprise-grade security capabilities. Focus on Phase 1 priorities and always optimize for developer delight.**
