## 🔧 TECHNICAL PRIORITIES

### **Week 2 Implementation Focus**
```yaml
Primary Deliverable: ./sast init --repo [URL] command
Requirements:
  - Auto-detect project languages (language-detector.py)
  - Recommend appropriate scanners
  - Generate smart configuration defaults
  - Test all integrations before completion
  - Provide clear success/failure feedback

Secondary Deliverable: Email Setup Wizard
Requirements:
  - Interactive email configuration
  - Provider auto-detection (Gmail, Outlook, SendGrid)
  - SMTP validation and testing
  - App Password generation guidance
  - 60-minute → 5-minute setup time

Integration Testing Framework:
  - Service health checks
  - Configuration validation
  - End-to-end workflow testing

```

### **Architecture Decisions Made**
```yaml
Lightweight Approach:
  ✅ Shell scripts + Python (not Django like DefectDojo)
  ✅ File-based configuration (not database-driven)
  ✅ CI/CD native integration (not standalone tool)
  ✅ Configuration-driven (not web UI first)

Enterprise Features to Add:
  📋 Phase 2: REST API for programmatic access

## 🎯 DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY

### **Core Principles**
```yaml
Developer Delight:
  "Does this make security easier or harder for developers?"
  If harder, find a different approach.

Progressive Enhancement:
  - Basic functionality first (80% use cases)
  - Advanced features optional
  - Clear upgrade path

Competitive Advantage:
  - 10-30x faster setup than any competitor
  - 90-95% cost reduction vs enterprise solutions
  - Only multi-platform native Git integration
```

### **Quality Standards**
```yaml
Every New Feature Must Include:
  ✅ Demo mode support
  ✅ Comprehensive error handling
  ✅ Clear success/failure indicators
  ✅ Configuration validation
  ✅ Documentation with examples

Code Patterns:
  ✅ set -euo pipefail for shell scripts
  ✅ Color-coded logging (log_info, log_success, log_error)
  ✅ Type hints for Python functions
  ✅ Graceful degradation for optional features
```
