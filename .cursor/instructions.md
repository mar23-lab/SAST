# üîí SAST Platform - Cursor AI Instructions
## Developer-First Security Scanning Platform

You are working on a **production-ready SAST (Static Application Security Testing) platform** designed to provide enterprise-grade security scanning with exceptional developer experience.

## üéØ PROJECT MISSION

Transform security scanning from a developer burden into a delightful experience by delivering DefectDojo-grade enterprise capabilities with 10x superior developer UX.

**Competitive Position**: "DefectDojo for Developers" - Enterprise security that developers actually want to use.

## üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Core Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Shell scripts + Python (lightweight vs DefectDojo's Django)
- **Scanners**: CodeQL, Semgrep, Bandit, ESLint (multi-scanner approach)
- **Monitoring**: InfluxDB, Grafana, Prometheus (enterprise observability)
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose (container-native)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Bitbucket Pipelines, GitLab CI

## üéØ CURRENT DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES

### **Phase 1: Competitive Advantage Acceleration** (Week 2 - CURRENT)
**Target**: Achieve setup time parity with DefectDojo (30 min) then surpass (15 min)

#### Week 2 Focus (CURRENT PRIORITY):
```bash
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:
- Implement ./sast init --repo [URL] command
- Auto-detect languages and recommend scanners  
- Test all integrations before completion

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Setup time: 2.5h ‚Üí 30 min (vs DefectDojo 2-8h)
- Setup success rate: 30% ‚Üí 70% (vs DefectDojo ~60%)
- Zero-configuration success: 0% ‚Üí 60% (unique market position)

DELIVERABLES:
- sast-init.sh (main onboarding script)
- language-detector.py (auto-detect project languages)
- integration-tester.sh (validate all connections)
- Quick-start templates for common project types
```

## üîß DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

### Code Quality Standards
```yaml
Shell Scripts:
  - Use bash with set -euo pipefail for error handling
  - Include comprehensive logging (log_info, log_error functions)
  - Color-coded output for user experience
  - Validate all dependencies before execution
  - Provide --help and usage examples

Python Scripts:
  - Type hints for all function parameters
  - Comprehensive error handling with try/catch
  - JSON/YAML processing with proper validation
  - CLI interfaces using argparse
  - Unit tests for critical functions

Configuration:
  - YAML format with clear commenting
  - Environment variable support
  - Validation schemas where possible
  - Example configurations for common scenarios
```

### Architecture Principles
```yaml
Developer Experience First:
  - Convention over configuration
  - Zero-configuration defaults that work for 80% of cases
  - Progressive enhancement (basic ‚Üí advanced features)
  - Clear error messages with actionable solutions

Security by Design:
  - Secure defaults (fail-safe, conservative thresholds)
  - Secrets management via environment variables
  - HTTPS/TLS for all external communications
  - Input validation and sanitization

Observability:
  - Comprehensive logging at all levels
  - Metrics collection for performance monitoring
  - Health checks for all services
  - Audit trails for security events
```

## üìã STANDARD DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS

### Configuration Management Pattern
```bash
# Standard pattern for reading configuration
CONFIG_FILE="${CONFIG_FILE:-ci-config.yaml}"
if [[ ! -f "$CONFIG_FILE" ]]; then
    log_error "Configuration file not found: $CONFIG_FILE"
    echo "Run: cp ci-config.yaml.example ci-config.yaml"
    exit 1
fi

# Use yq for YAML processing
SETTING=$(yq eval '.section.parameter // "default_value"' "$CONFIG_FILE")
```

### Service Health Check Pattern
```bash
# Standard health check with retries
check_service_health() {
    local service_name="$1"
    local health_url="$2"
    local max_retries="${3:-30}"
    
    for ((i=1; i<=max_retries; i++)); do
        if curl -s "$health_url" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
            log_success "$service_name is ready"
            return 0
        fi
        log_info "Waiting for $service_name... ($i/$max_retries)"
        sleep 2
    done
    
    log_error "$service_name failed to start after $max_retries attempts"
    return 1
}
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```bash
# Comprehensive error handling with cleanup
set -euo pipefail

cleanup_on_error() {
    log_error "Operation failed. Cleaning up..."
    docker-compose down >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
    exit 1
}

trap cleanup_on_error ERR
```

## üí° DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY

### "Developer Delight Through Security Excellence"
Every change should ask: "Does this make security easier or harder for developers?" If it makes it harder, find a different approach.

### Progressive Enhancement Approach
1. **Basic functionality first** - Works out of the box for 80% of cases
2. **Advanced features optional** - Power users can customize
3. **Clear upgrade path** - Simple ‚Üí Advanced configuration
4. **Graceful degradation** - Partial failures don't break everything

### Competitive Advantage Focus
```yaml
Speed: 10-30x faster setup than any competitor
Cost: 90-95% cost reduction vs enterprise solutions
Platform: Only multi-platform native Git integration
UX: Only developer-first enterprise security platform
```

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### This Week Priority
1. **Email wizard completion** - scripts/email_setup_wizard.sh
2. **One-command setup** - sast-init.sh development
3. **Language detection** - language-detector.py implementation
4. **Integration testing** - integration-tester.sh framework

### Success Definition
**The project succeeds when a developer can run `./sast init --repo [URL]` and have a fully functional, enterprise-grade security scanning platform operational in under 15 minutes with 90%+ success rate.**
